# 📜 License Policy for KarmaMeter™

KarmaMeter™ is a mission-driven project focused on collective well-being, truthfulness, and digital ethics. To protect its vision and ensure long-term alignment with those values, we chose a multi-layered open license strategy.

## 🔐 Why We Chose AGPLv3 for Code

All source code in this repository is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). This license was selected to:

- ✅ Guarantee freedom to use, study, modify, and share
- ✅ Ensure that **modifications made in hosted services** are also shared
- 🚫 Prevent closed forks or proprietary monetization of KarmaMeter™
- ✅ Support community collaboration while preserving user freedoms

AGPLv3 aligns with KarmaMeter’s purpose as an **ethical flagship tool**, not a commercial product.

## 🎨 Why We Chose CC BY-NC-SA for Content

All **non-code content**—including documentation, designs, UI mockups, and social media templates—is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

This content license:
- 📤 Allows sharing and remixing
- 📚 Encourages learning and adaptation

It protects the educational intent while promoting creative freedom in the community.

## ❓Why Not MIT License?

The MIT License is a popular permissive license that allows full reuse, including commercial reuse, without requiring derivative works to remain open.

We intentionally did **not** choose MIT because:
- It allows proprietary forks of ethical projects
- It enables usage in products that could conflict with KarmaMeter’s purpose
- It doesn’t require openness or attribution in hosted SaaS deployments

> ☝️ While we didn’t choose the MIT license for this project, the creator of KarmaMeter™ — Dhanesh Sanjeev Tatuskar — **does plan to get into MIT (the university)**. And with that, carry forward a spirit of openness, rigor, and ethics that this project represents.
