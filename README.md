# KarmaMeter™ – A Truth & Positivity Engine for Group Chats

**KarmaMeter™** is an open-source project built to **measure and elevate the spiritual, emotional, and ethical quality of digital communication**, focusing on **group chats** (like WhatsApp, Telegram) and **other social media platforms**. It aims to foster conscious communication and positivity in all forms of online interaction.

It uses principles of:
- 📊 Sentiment analysis  
- 🧠 Truthfulness estimation  
- 🧘‍♀️ Collective consciousness modeling  
- ✨ Factual summarization and negativity filtering  

to compute a **karma score** and enhance the quality of messages and group interactions.

## 🌱 Vision & Purpose

This project aims to:
- Encourage conscious communication  
- Track digital positivity  
- Reward truthfulness & emotional harmony  
- Promote clarity through summarization and the removal of toxic patterns  

KarmaMeter™ is not a product — it is a **tool for positive transformation and public good**.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Message parsing** from chat exports or APIs  
2. **Sentiment & truth scoring** using NLP and user-trained models  
3. **Karma score generation** per message, user, and group  
4. **Factual summarization** of message threads to highlight meaningful insights and reduce noise  
5. **Negativity filtering** to detect and flag harmful, false, or divisive content  
6. **Visualizations** of group health and positivity over time  

Coming soon: a web dashboard, browser extension, and mobile integrations.
