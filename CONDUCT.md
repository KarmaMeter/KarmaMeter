# Governance and Contribution Guidelines

## Decision Making

KarmaMeter™ is an open-source project, and decisions are made collectively. Major decisions about the project’s direction will be made through discussions within the community and by the maintainers.

## Dispute Resolution

In the case of disagreements, all parties are encouraged to work towards a constructive solution. If needed, project maintainers will mediate the issue.
